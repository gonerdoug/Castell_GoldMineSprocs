# Castell_GoldMineSprocs
MSSQL Stored Procedures for use with GoldMine CRM

These procedures provide an SQL-based API useful for carrying out business logic functions in GoldMine CRM such as creating/updating contact records, history actions, etc. 

Pre-requisite for correct functionality is the CastellRecNoGen DLL for generating the unique identifiers GoldMine uses for primary/foreign key relationships and timestamps. 

That CLR DLL (and the associated SQL functions) can be purched for $100 US here: http://www.castellcomputers.com/?page_id=123 )
